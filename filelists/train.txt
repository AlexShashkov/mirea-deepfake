dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_2_8_short.wav|here is the truth.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_2_9_long.wav|the former president of the united states of america, has created and spread a web of lies, about the twenty twenty election.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_2_9_long_2.wav|he’s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests, as more important than his country’s interests and america’s interests.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_10_long.wav|the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win, is to suppress your vote, and subvert our elections.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_10_long_2.wav|wrong. it’s undemocratic. and frankly, it’s unamerican. the second big lie, being told by the former president and his supporters.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_11_long.wav|is that the results of the election of twenty twenty can’t be trusted. the truth is that, no election! no election in american history has been more closely scrutinized.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_11_long_2.wav|or more carefully counted. every legal challenge questioning the results, in every court in this country.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_12_long.wav|that could have been made, was made and was rejected. often rejected by republican appointed judges
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_12_long_2.wav|including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the united states supreme court. recounts were undertaken in state after state.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_13_long.wav|georgia, georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand. phony partisan audits were undertaken.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_13_long_2.wav|long after the election in several states. none, changed the results. and in some of them the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_1_long.wav|trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. they seem no longer to want to be the party.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_1_long_2.wav|the party of lincoln, eisenhower, reagan, the bushes. but whatever my other disagreements are with republicans who support the rule of law.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_2_long.wav|and not the rule of a single man, i will always seek to work together with them, to find shared solutions where possible. because if we have a shared belief in democracy.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_2_long_2.wav|then anything is possible, anything. and so at this moment, we must decide, what kind of nation are we going to be.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_3_long.wav|Are we gonna be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm? are we gonna be a nation, where we allow partisan election officials to overturn.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_3_long_2.wav|the legally expressed will of the people? are we gonna be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth, but in the shadow, of lies.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_4_long.wav|we cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. the way forward, is to recognize the truth, and to live by it.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_4_long_2.wav|the big lie being told by the former president and many republicans, who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place, on election day.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_5_long.wav|november three third, two thousand and twenty. Think about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought, when you voted that day.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_5_long_2.wav|taking part in an insurrection is that what you thought you were doing? or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen, and voting.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_7_long.wav|can you think of a more twisted way, to look at this country to look at america? i cannot. here’s the truth. the election of twenty twenty.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_7_long_2.wav|was the greatest, demonstration of democracy in the history of this country. more of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of american history.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_8_long.wav|over hundred and fifty million americans went to the polls and voted that day, in a pandemic some at grease grea grea great risk to their lives.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_8_long_2.wav|they should be applauded, not attacked. right now, in state after state, new laws are being written. not to protect the vote, but to deny it.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_long.wav|not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it. not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost. instead of looking at the election results from twenty twenty and saying.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_short.wav|they need new ideas.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_short_2.wav|or better ideas.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_3_9_short_3.wav|to win more votes.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_10_long.wav|but their plot was foiled. congressmen democrats and republicans stayed. senators representatives staff, they finished their work the constitution demanded. they honored their oath

dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_2_long.wav|there is simply zero proof! the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue, where evidence had to be produced, and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_2_short.wav|president failed to make his case.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_2_short_2.wav|оust think about this.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_3_long.wav|the former president and his supporters, have never been able to explain, how they accept as accurate, the other election results that took place.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_3_long_2.wav|on november third. the elections for governor, united states senate, the house of representatives, elections, in which they closed the gap, in the house.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_4_long.wav|they challenge none of that. the president’s name was first, then we went down the line, governors senators house of representatives. somehow those results were accurate on the same ballot.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_4_long_2.wav|presidential race was flawed? and on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_5_long.wav|the only difference. the former president didn’t lose those races. he just lost the one that was his own. finally, the third big lie being told by a former president and his supporters.

dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_4_7_long.wav|to me the true patriots were the more than hundred fifty americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this capitol.

dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_5_2_middle_3.wav|both at home and abroad, we’re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy.

dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_6_1_middle_2.wav|from China, to Russia and beyond, they’re betting that democracy’s days are numbered.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_6_1_middle_3.wav|actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division, to succeed in today’s rapidly changing complicated world.
dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_6_2_middle.wav|and they’re betting, they’re betting america will become more like them.

dataset/wavs/FGQZokwAufM_7_4_middle_3.wav|the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.

dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_2_2_short.wav|i thank them from the bottom of my heart.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_middle.wav|each of these patriots, have taken, the oath first sworn, by george washington.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_middle_2.wav|but the american story, depends not on any one of us, not on some of us.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_middle_3.wav|but on all of us. on we the people, who seek a more perfect union.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_short.wav|this is a great nation.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_1_short_2.wav|we are a good people.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle.wav|and over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we've come so far.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle_2.wav|but we still have far to go. we'll press forward.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle_3.wav|with speed and urgency for we have much to do, in this winter of peril.
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_2_middle_4.wav|and significant possibility. much to repair! much to restore!
dataset/wavs/j3a6n_1owPY_44100_4_3_middle.wav|much to heal! much to build! and much to gain. few people in our nation’s history, have been more challenged.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_17_long_1.wav|for you and i that america thrives, when we give our hearts we may turn our hands to common purpose.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_17_long_2.wav|and right now, my friends, we're doing just that. and i've to say, as your president, i'm grateful to you. last summer i was in philadelphia, i met a small business owner, a woman.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_18_long.wav|i asked her, i said what do you need most. never forget what she said to me. she said looking me in my eyes she said i just want the truth. the truth. just tell me the truth.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_18_middle.wav|think of that. my fellow americans, you're owed nothing less than the truth.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_19_long.wav|and for all of you asking, when things will get back to normal, here is the truth. the only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_19_middle.wav|is to beat the virus. you've been hearing me say that for while i was running and the last fifty days i've been president.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_20_long.wav|but this is one of the most complex operations we've under and ever undertaken as a nation in a long time. that's why i'm using every power i have as president of the united states
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_20_middle.wav|to put us on a war footing to get the job done. it sounds like hyperbole but i mean it a war footing.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_24_long.wav|and now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, johnson and johnson is working together with the competitor, merck, to speed up and increase the capacity
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_24_short.wav|to manufacture new johnson and johnson vaccine, which was one shot.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_25_long.wav|in fact just yesterday i announced and i met with the ceos of both companies, i announced our plan to buy an additional one hundred million doses of johnson and johnson vaccines.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_25_middle.wav|these two companies, competitors, have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applauded for it.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_26_long.wav|it's truly a national effort, just like we saw during world war two. now because all the work we've done, we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in america by the end of may.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_26_middle.wav|that's months ahead of schedule. and we're mobilizing thousand of vaccinators to put the vacine in one's arm.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_27_long.wav|calling on active duty military, fema, retired doctors and nurses, administrators and those to administer the shots. and we've been creating more places to get the shots.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_27_middle.wav|we've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one, any one of ten thousand pharmacies across the country.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_28_long.wav|just like you get your flu shot. we're also working with governors and mayors in red states and blue states to set up and support nearly six hundred federally supported vaccination centers
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_28_short.wav|that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_29_long.wav|you can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car and drive home in less than an hour. we've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_29_short.wav|all across america, located and underserved areas.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_2_long.wav|the last vacation. the last birthday with frends. the last holiday with extended family. while it was different for everyone, we all lost something. a collective suffering.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_2_middle.wav|a collective sacrifice. a year filled with the loss of life the loss of living for all of us.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_32_long.wav|when i took office fifty days ago, only eight percent of americans after months, only eight percent of those over the age of sixty five had gotten their first vaccination.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_32_short.wav|today that number's sixty five percent.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_33_long.wav|just fourteen percent of americans over the age of seventy five, fifty fifty days ago, had gotten their first shot. today that number is well over seventy percent.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_33_middle.wav|with new guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc that came out on monday. it means simply this.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_34_long.wav|millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. and the more people are fully vacinated the cd will continue to provide additional guidance
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_34_middle.wav|on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends as well as travel.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_35_long.wav|when i came in office, you may recall, i said a goal that many you said was that kind of way over the top. i said i intended to get a hundred million shots in people's arms in my first hundred days in office.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_35_middle.wav|tonight i can say we're not only going to meet that goal, we're going to beat that goal.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_37_long.wav|first, tonight i'm announcing that i will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults, people eighteen and over, eligible to be vaccinated no later than may one.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_37_middle.wav|let me say that again. all adult americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than may one.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_39_long.wav|and to do this we're gonna go from a million shots a day that i promised in december, before i was sworn in, to maintaining, beating our current pace of two million shots a day
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_39_short.wav|outpacing the rest of the world.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_3_long.wav|but in the loss we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect and gratitude. finding light in the darkness is a very american thing to do.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_3_middle.wav|in fact, it may be the most american thing we do. and that's what we've done.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_40_long.wav|secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in may, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_40_middle.wav|including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_41_long.wav|no more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones. thirdly, with the passage of the american rescue plan, and i thank again the house and senate for passing it
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_41_middle.wav|and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff including busdrivers.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_42_long.wav|we can accelerate massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely. and meet my goal, that i stated at the same time about a hundred million shots of opening majority of k through eight schools
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_42_short.wav|in my first hundred days in office.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_43_long.wav|this is gonna be the number one priority of my new secretary of education, miguel cardona. fourth, in the coming weeks we will issue further guidance
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_43_middle.wav|on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe and encourage more people to get vaccinated.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_44_long.wav|and finally fifth, and maybe most importantly, i promise i will do everything in my power, i will not relent until we beat this virus. but i need you
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_44_middle.wav|the american people. i need you. i need every american to do their part. that's not hyperbole. i need you.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_46_long.wav|because here's the point, if we do all this, if we do our part, we do this together by july the fourth there's a good chance you, your families and friends
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_46_middle.wav|will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighbourhood and have a cookout and a barberque and celebrate independence day.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_48_long.wav|where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus. but to get there we can't let our guard down.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_48_middle.wav|this fight is far from order, from over. as i told the woman in pennsylvania, i'll tell you the truth.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_49_long.wav|a july fourth with your loved once is the goal. but a goal a lot can happen. conditions can change. the scientists have made clear, that things may get worse again
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_49_short.wav|as new variants of the virus spread.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_4_long_1.wav|we've seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives, sometimes losing them, to save and help others. researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_4_long_2.wav|and so many of you, as hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. i know it's been hard. i truly know.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_50_long.wav|we've got work to do to ensure that everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines. so my message to you is this. listen to doctor fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_50_short.wav|he's assured us the vaccines are safe.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_51_long.wav|they underwent rigorous scientific review. i know they're safe. vice president harronis harris and i know they're safe. that's why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_51_middle.wav|so for the world to see, so you could see us do it. the first lady and the second gentleman also got vaccinated.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_52_long.wav|talk to your family, friends, your neighbors, the people you know best who've gotten the vaccine. we need everyone to get vaccinated. we need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distance
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_52_short.wav|and keep wearing the mask as recommended by the cdc.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_53_long.wav|cause even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity. and national unity isn't just how politics and politicians vote in washington
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_53_middle.wav|or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. unity is what we do together as fellow americans.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_54_long.wav|because if we don't stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. please, we don't want to do that again. we've made so much progress.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_54_short.wav|this is not the time to let up.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_55_long.wav|just as we're emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules. i'll close with this.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_55_middle.wav|we've lost so much over the last year. we've lost family and friends. we've lost businesses and dreams we spent years building.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_56_long.wav|we've lost time, time with each other. and our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. no graduation ceremonies this this spring, no graduations from college, high school
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_56_short.wav|moving up ceremonies. you know, there's something else we lost.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_57_long.wav|we lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the american people. but as i stand here tonight, we're proving once again something i've said
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_57_short.wav|time and time again and they're probably tired to hear me say it.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_58_long.wav|i said it foreign leaders ard domestic alike. it's never, ever a good bet to bet against the american people. america is coming back.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_58_middle.wav|the development, manufacture and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_59_long.wav|it's one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished. we also just saw the perseverance rover land on mars. stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_59_middle.wav|another example of the extraordinary american ingenuity, commitment and belief in science and one another.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_5_long_1.wav|i've told you before, i carry a card in my pocket with the number of americans who have died from covid to date. it's on the back of my schedule.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_5_long_2.wav|as of now, total deaths in america five hundred and twenty seven thousand seven hundred and twenty six.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_60_long.wav|and today i signed into law the american rescue plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions people
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_60_short.wav|includes one thousand four hundred dollars in direct rescue checks, payments.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_64_long.wav|in the coming weeks and months i'll be traveling along with the first lady, the vice president, the second gentleman, members of my cabinet to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the american rescue plan meets the moment.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_64_short.wav|and if it fails at any pay i will acknowledge that it failed.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_65_long.wav|but it will not. about how after long dark years one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead. if we all do our part
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_65_middle.wav|this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_66_long_1.wav|we will have proven once again, that this country can do anything. hard thigs, big things, important things. over a year ago
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_66_long_2.wav|no one could've imagined what we were about to go through. but now we're coming through it. and it's a shared experience binds us together as a nation.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_67_long_1.wav|we are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. we're also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_67_long_2.wav|my fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we've been through we'll come together as one people, one nation, one america.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_68_long.wav|i believe we can and we will. we're seizing this moment. and history, i believe, will record, we faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation's history.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_68_short.wav|darkest we've ever known.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_6_long_1.wav|that's more deaths than in world war one, world war two, the vietnam war and nine eleven combined. there were husbands, wives, sons and daughters.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_6_long_2.wav|grandparents, friends, neighbors, young and old. they leave behind love ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_70_long.wav|and there's nothing, nothing, from the bottom of my heart i believe, that there's nothing we can't do when we do it together. so god bless you all.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_70_middle.wav|and please, god, give solace to all those people who lost someone. and may god protect our troops.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_7_long.wav|but i'm also thinking about everyone else, who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other diseases. they too died alone.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_7_short.wav|they too leave behind loved ones who hurt him badly.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_8_long.wav|you know, you've often heard me say before, i talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child's bedroom to say i'm sorry, i lost my job.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_8_middle.wav|can't be here anymore. like my dad told me when he lost his job in scranton.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_9_long.wav|so many of you've had to make that same walk this past year. you lost your job. you closed your business. facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control.
dataset/wavs/JYBatFW-BP4_44100_01_9_short.wav|it may be worst of all a loss of hope.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_1_1_long.wav|good afternoon. before I begin today's announcement, let me take a few moments to thank, all the law enforcement folks for, all they did the military personnel.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_10_long.wav|businesses are closed for good. schools are caught in between. and while the vaccine provides so much hope, the rollout has been a dismal failure thus far.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_10_short.wav|so, i understand the despair and frustration of so many americans.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_11_long.wav|i understand why many governors, mayors, country officials, tribal leaders feel like they're left on their own without a clear national plan to get them through the crisis. let me be very clear.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_11_short.wav|things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_12_long.wav|the memorial we we held two nights ago, will not be our last one, unfortunately. the death toll will likely top five hundred thousand next month. the cases will continue to mount.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_12_short.wav|we didn't get into this mess overnight. that's going to take months for us to turn things around.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_13_middle.wav|but let me be equally clear, we will get through this. we will defeat this pandemic.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_13_short.wav|and to a nation waiting for action let me be the clearest on this point.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_14_middle.wav|this plan reflects ah the ideas i set forward during the campaign, and ah further refined over the past three months.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_15_middle.wav|our national strategy is comprehensive. it's based on science, not politics. it's based on truth, not denial. and it's detailed.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_15_short.wav|you can review this entire plan, this entire plan.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_16_short.wav|and and and and pro complete detail, what we're going to do.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_18_middle.wav|and i explained, as i explained last week, we will move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated for free.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_18_short.wav|and create more places for them to get vaccinated.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_19_middle.wav|yesterday, we got started. we directed the federal eh emergency management agency, fema.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_19_short.wav|to start standing up the first federally supported community vaccination centers.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_1_middle.wav|the president, as president as Commander In Chief, I always respect and Revere their service, and that of their families. but now to today's announcement.

dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_22_middle.wav|and to ensure we have enough vaccinators, the people doing the vaccines, to meet the nation's needs and quickly.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_22_short.wav|in addition to this effort.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_23_middle.wav|we allo, are going to take immediate steps to partner with governors, mayors, and other local officials, who we've been talking to all along, who are on the front lines of this fight.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_25_middle.wav|this is a model, we use to respond to hurricane hurricane sandy, which i was deeply invowed with.

dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_26_middle.wav|something democrats and republicans governors alike have called for. but the brutal truth is.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_26_short.wav|it's going to take months before we can get the majority of americans vaccinated.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_27_middle.wav|one of our one hundred day challenges is asking the american people to mask up.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_27_short.wav|for the first hundred days, the next ninety nine days.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_29_middle.wav|and if we do this as americans, the experts say by wearing a mask from now until april.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_29_short.wav|we'd save more than fifty thousand lives going forward.

dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_39_middle.wav|we're going to put the full force of the federal government, behind expanding testing by launching a covid nineteen pandemic testing board.
dataset/wavs/JzA37FofhmM_44100_2_39_short.wav|this effort will ensure that we get testing to where it is needed.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_3_1_short_2.wav|we will rue the day. russia has violated these ground rules, and continues to violate them.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_1_long.wav|so the united states will continue to stand with ukraine against russian aggression. we're providing support to help and train and assist your security forces, and we've relied on and rallied.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_3_short.wav|the cost imposed on moscow will continue to rise.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_5_4_middle.wav|the false propaganda, that the kremlin is disseminating in an attempt to undermine ukraine and fracture europe's resolve will not work.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_10_long_1.wav|that's not a future i believe any ukrainian wants for their children. that's why the minsk agreement needs to be implemented in full. and truly free and fair elections.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_11_long.wav|for if free elections occur, and the people determine, as i'm confident they will, that they want to remain and integral part.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_11_short_2.wav|that's what russia fears. that's what putin fears.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_12_long.wav|because all of you know the struggle for ukraine's freedom is not confined to the battlefields of the east. constitutional reform that includes judicial reform and decentralization does not compromise your sovereignty. it enhances it.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_12_short.wav|it's an important step to building a strong, new nation.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_1_long.wav|and i might add parenthetically, i don't think the russian people fully understand what Putin is doing. that's why he spends so much time hiding at home, the presence of russian forces.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_1_short.wav|here in your country.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_2_long.wav|heavy weapons must be withdrawn from the frontlines. the osce must be granted full, unencumbered access. russia, must press the separtists.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_5_long.wav|but we've made it clear to russia and the world, that continued delay and foot-dragging is unacceptable. that includes elections in the donbas. they can only go forward, as stipulated under the minsk agreement.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_5_short.wav|full access to the media must be provided.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_7_long.wav|that only happens if russia lives up to its commitments, if russia does its part. if it does, then you must follow through with yours.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_7_short.wav|because this is the best chance to keep donbas in ukraine, end the conflict.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_7_short_2.wav|and begin restoring ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_8_long.wav|it's hard. there's nothing easy about what you have to do. there's nothing easy. the pressure you will all get will be immense. i'd like to also speak.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_8_short.wav|directly, to the people in the donbas.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_9_long.wav|the alternative to what i just said is to continue to live under seperatists thugs, criminals who deny humanitarian aid, keep out organizations like doctors without borders, stealing lifesaving medicine to sell on the black market.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_6_9_short.wav|that's not a future.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_10_middle.wav|russia is trynna undermine the stability and sovereignty of ukraine any way they can't, including squeezing ukraine financially, trynna undermine your economy.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_10_short.wav|they view that as a cheaper way than sending tanks across the line of contact.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_10_short_1.wav|it's in the national security interest of the nation.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_11_middle_1.wav|so ukraine must be strong enough to choose its own future, strongly. strong defensively.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_11_middle_2.wav|strong economically. a strong system of democratic governance. the united states is with you in this fight.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_11_short.wav|we understand we're with you afar. it's much harder for you than it is for us.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_12_middle.wav|we've stepped up with official assistance to help backstop the ukrainian economy. we've rallied the international community to commit a total of twenty five billion dollars in bilateral and multilateral financing.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_15_middle.wav|but for ukraine to continue to make progress and to keep the support of the international community you have to do more, as well. the big part of moving forward with your imf program.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_15_short.wav|it requires difficult reforms. and they are difficult. let me say parenthetically here.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_17_middle.wav|to vote to raise the pension age, is to write your political obituary in many places.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_17_middle_2.wav|don't misunderstand that those of us who serve in other democratic insitutions don't understand how hard the conditions are, how difficult it is.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_17_short.wav|to cast some of the votes to meet the obligations committed to under the imf.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_18_middle.wav|it requires sacrifices that might not be politically expedient or popular. but they're critical to putting ukraine on the path to a future.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_18_middle_2.wav|that is economically secure. and i urge you to stay the course as hard as it is. ukraine needs a budget that's consistent with your imf commitments.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_1_long.wav|autonomous, independent states, their determination to have their own police forces, their determination to have their own education system, to have their own government under, the united constitution.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_20_middle.wav|the ukrainian people've long struggled to direct their own destinies, to carve out a place, besides the mighty dnipro.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_7_long.wav|it's not enough to push through law to increase transparency with regard to official sources of income. senior elected officials have to remove all conflicts between their business interest and their governent responsibilities.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_7_9_long.wav|corruption siphons away resources from the people. it blunts the economic growth, and it affronts the human dignity. we know that. you know that. the ukrainian people know that.
dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_8_1_middle.wav|i will speak for of ukraine. i will speak of the writer who took a beating on the maidan to put him in the hospital. when asked, why he.

dataset/wavs/nhP5buMAZ7w_44100_9_9_middle.wav|i used to wonder as a young senator, when i first stood up on the senate floor, and i've never been.

dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_52_middle.wav|I'll be a president who stand with our allies and friends and make it clear to our adversaries, the days of cozying up to dictators is over.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_53_long.wav|Under president Biden, America will not turn a blind eye to Russian bounties, on the heads of American soldiers. Nor'll i put up with foreign interference in our most sacred democratic exercise, voting.

dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_54_long.wav|For a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world. History, history has thrust, one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_54_long_2.wav|that finally wipes out the stain of racism, from our national character? I believe we’re up to it. I believe we’re ready. Just a week ago yesterday.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_55_long.wav|Was the third anniversary of the events in Charlottesville. Close your eyes, remember to sound television remember seeing those neo nazis and klansmen and white supremacists, coming out of the fields with lighted torches?
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_55_short.wav|Veins bulging? Spewing, the same, same antisemitic bile.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_56_long.wav|Heard across Europe in the thirties? Remember the violent clash that ensued, between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it? Remember what the president said?
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_56_middle.wav|He said there were quote, very fine people, on both sides. It was a wake up call for us as a country.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_57_long.wav|And for me, a call to action. At that moment, i knew i’d have to run. My father taught us that silence, was complicity. And i can never remain silent or complicit.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_57_long_2.wav|At the time, i said we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. And we are. You know.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_58_long.wav|One of the most important conversations i’ve had this entire campaign, is with someone with someone who is much too young to vote. I met with six year old Gianna Floyd, a day before her daddy George Floyd was laid to rest.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_58_middle.wav|She is incredibly brave long girl. I’ll never forget it when I leaned down.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_59_long.wav|To speak with her, she looked into my eyes and she said in night cot, daddy, changed the world. Daddy, changed the world. Her words burrowed deep into my heart.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_59_middle.wav|Maybe George Floyd’s murder, was the breaking point. Maybe John Lewis’ passing the inspiration.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_5_long.wav|This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment. It’s a moment that calls for hope, and light and love. Hope, for our futures, light to see our way forward, and love for one another.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_5_middle.wav|America isn’t just a collection of, clashing interests, of red states or blue states.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_60_long.wav|But are however it has come to be, however it's happened. America is ready to in John’s words, to lay down cost the heavy burdens of hate, at last
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_60_long_2.wav|and to do the hard work, of rooting out, our systemic racism. You know, America’s history tells us, that it been in our darkest moments.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_61_long.wav|That we’ve made our greatest progress. That we’ve found the light. And in this dark moment, i believe we are poised to make great progress again.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_61_long_2.wav|That we can find the light once more. You know, many people of heard me said this but i always believed you can define America in one word. Possibilities.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_62_long.wav|That defined in future America everything is possible. That America everyone, and I mean everyone, should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God given ability will take them.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_62_middle.wav|We can never lose that. In times as challenging as these, i believe there is only one way forward.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_63_long.wav|As a united America, are united America. United in our pursuit of a more perfect union. United, in our dreams of a better future, for us and for our children.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_63_long_2.wav|United in our determination, to make the coming years bright. Are we ready? I believe we are.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_64_long.wav|This is a great nation we are a good and decent people. For large say this is the United, States of America. And there has never been anything, we’ve been unable to accomplish, when we’ve done it together.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_64_middle.wav|The Irish poet Seamus Heaney, once wrote. History says.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_65_long.wav|Don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope, and history rhyme.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_65_long_2.wav|This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme! With passion and purpose, let us begin! You and i together, one nation under God.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_66_long.wav|United in our love for America, united in our love for each other! For love is more powerful hate! Hope is more powerful than fear! And light is more powerful than dark! This is our moment! This is our mission!
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_66_short.wav|May history be able to say.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_67_long.wav|That the end of this chapter of American darkness began here tonight, as love and hope and light, joined in the battle, for the soul of the nation. And this is a battle we will win and we'll do it together!
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_67_middle.wav|I promise you. Thank you. And may God bless you. And may God protect our troops. Good night!
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_6_long.wav|We’re so much bigger than that. We’re so much better than that. Now nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt, pledged a new deal, in a time of massive unemployment, uncertainty and fear.

dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_7_long.wav|And he believed America could as well. And he did. And we can as well. This campaign isn’t just about winning votes. It’s about winning the heart and yes the soul of America.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_7_short.wav|Winning it for the generous among us, not the selfish.
dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_8_long.wav|Winning it for the workers who keep this country going not just the privileged few at the top. Winning it for those communities, who have known the injustice of the knee on the neck.

dataset/wavs/rmN90VuLH6Y_1_9_long_2.wav|You know. No generation ever knows what history will ask of it. All we can ever know, is whether we’ll be ready, when that moment arrives.

dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_10_middle_2.wav|it's the details of life that matter most and we've missed those details. the big details and small moments.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_11_middle.wav|weddings, birthdays, graduations, all the things that needed to happen but didn't.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_11_middle_2.wav|the first date. the family reunions. the sunday night rituals. it's all
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_11_short.wav|as exacted terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_1_long.wav|my fellow americans. tonight, i'd like to talk to you about where we are, as we mark one year since everything stopped, because of this pandemic.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_1_middle.wav|a year ago we were hit with the virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_2_long.wav|denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness. photos and videos from twenty nineteen
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_2_long_2.wav|feel like they were taken in another era. the last vacation. the last birthday with friends. the last holiday with extended family.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_3_long.wav|while it was different for everyone, we all lost something. a collective suffering. a collective sacrifice. a year filled with the loss of life
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_3_long_2.wav|the loss of living for all of us. but in the loss we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect and gratitude.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_4_long.wav|finding light in the darkness is a very american thing to do. in fact it may be the most american thing we do. and that's what we've done.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_4_long_2.wav|we've seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives sometimes losing them to save and help others. researches and scientists racing for a vaccine.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_5_long.wav|and so many of you, as hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places. i know it's been hard. i truly know.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle.wav|as of now total deaths in america five hundred and twenty seven thousand
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle_2.wav|seven hundred and twenty six. that's more deaths than in world war one, world war two
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle_3.wav|the vietnam war and nine eleven combined. there were husbands
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_6_middle_4.wav|wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors, young and old.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_7_middle.wav|they leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heel, even to have a funeral. but i'm also thinking about everyone else
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_7_middle_2.wav|who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident or other diseases.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_7_middle_3.wav|they too died alone. they too leave behind loved once who are hurting badly.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_8_middle.wav|you know you've often heard me say before, i talk about the longest walk any parent can make
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_8_middle_2.wav|is up a short flight of stairs to his child's bedroom to say i'm sorry, but lost my job.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_8_middle_3.wav|can't be here anymore. like my dad told me when he lost his job in scranton.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_9_middle.wav|so many of you had to make that same walk this past year. you're lost your job, you closed your business.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_1_9_middle_2.wav|facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, maybe worst of all a loss of hope.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_13_middle.wav|and now at the direction and with the assistance of my administration johnson and johnson
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_13_middle_2.wav|is working together with the competitor, merck, to speed up and increase the capacity
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_13_short.wav|to manufacture new johnson and johnson vaccine, which is one shot.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_14_middle.wav|in fact just yesterday I announced and I met with the ceos of both companies, I announced our plan
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_14_middle_2.wav|to buy an additional one hundred million doses of johnson and johnson vaccines.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_14_middle_3.wav|these two companies, competitors, have come together for the good of the nation and they should be applauded for it.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_15_middle.wav|it's truly a national effort, just like we saw during world war two. now because all the work we've done
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_15_middle_2.wav|we'll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in america by the end of may.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_15_middle_3.wav|that's months ahead of schedule. and we're mobilizing thousand of vaccinators to put the vacine in one's arm.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_16_middle.wav|calling on active duty military, fima, retired doctors and nurses, administrators and those to administer the shots.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_16_middle_2.wav|we've made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one, any one of ten thousand pharmacies across the country.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_16_short.wav|and we've been creating more places to get the shots.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_17_middle.wav|just like you get your flu shot. we're also working with governors and mayors, in red states and blue states
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_17_middle_2.wav|federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_17_short.wav|to set up in support nearly six hundred
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short.wav|you can drive up to a stadium or a large parky lot
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short_2.wav|get your shot, never leave your car and drive home in less than an hour.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short_3.wav|we've been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_18_short_4.wav|all across America, located and underserved areas.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_1_middle.wav|grandparents haven't seen their children or grandchildren. parents haven't seen their kids. kids haven't seen their friends.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_1_middle_2.wav|the things we used to do, that always filled us with joy, have become the things we couldn't do
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_1_middle_3.wav|and broke our hearts. too often we've turned against one another.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short.wav|when i took office fifty days ago
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short_2.wav|only eight percent of americans after months
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short_3.wav|only eight percent of those over the age of sixty five had gotten their first vaccination.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_21_short_4.wav|today that number's sixty five percent.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short.wav|just fourteen percent of americans
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short_2.wav|over the age of seventy five, fifty, fifty days ago, had gotten their first shot.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short_3.wav|today that number is well over seventy percent.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short_4.wav|with new guidance from the centers for disease contol and prevention, the cdc
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_22_short_5.wav|that came out on Monday, it means simply this.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_24_short.wav|and the more people who are fully vaccinated
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_24_short_2.wav|the cd will continue to provide additional guidance
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_24_short_3.wav|on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with your friends
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_24_short_4.wav|as well as travel.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_24_short_5.wav|when I came in office, you may recall
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_24_short_6.wav|I set a goal that many of you said was, that kind of way over the top
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_27_short.wav|first, tonight
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_27_short_2.wav|i'm announcing that i will direct all states, tribes and territories
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_27_short_3.wav|to make all adults, people eighteen and over
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_27_short_4.wav|eligible to be vaccinated no later than may one.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_27_short_5.wav|let me say that again
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_27_short_6.wav|all adult americans will be eligible to get a vaccine
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_27_short_7.wav|no later than may one.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_29_short.wav|to do this
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_29_short_2.wav|we're gonna go from a million shots today that I promised in December
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_29_short_3.wav|before i was sworn in, to maintaining
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_29_short_4.wav|beating our current pace of two million shots a day
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_29_short_5.wav|outpacing the rest of the world.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_2_middle.wav|a mask, the easiest thing to do to save lives, sometimes it divides us.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_2_middle_2.wav|vicious hate crimes against asian americans, who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_2_short.wav|states pitted against one another instead of working with each other.

dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_30_short_2.wav|we will launch, with our partners

dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_30_short_4.wav|to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_30_short_5.wav|including a new website that will help you first find the place
dataset/wavs/tPJ9HodCOL8_2_30_short_6.wav|to get vacinated and the one nearest you.
