dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_24_1_long.wav|we also need to level the playing field with china and other competitors. that's why it's so important to pass the bipartisan innovation act sitting in congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and american manufacturing.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_24_2_long.wav|wish to invest almost two percent of rgdp in research and development. we don't now. can't. china is. let me give you one example why it's so important a pass.

dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_29_1_short_1.wav|look.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_29_1_short_2.wav|﻿our economy roared back faster than most anyone predicted.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_29_3_long.wav|the panic also disrupted the global supply chains. factories close, when that happens it takes longer to make goods and get them to the warehouses, to the stores and go prices go up.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_29_3_short_1.wav|﻿look at cars last year.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_29_3_short_2.wav|﻿one third of all the inflation was because of automobile sales.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_29_4_long.wav|there weren't enough semiconductors to make all the cars the people wanted to buy, and guess what, prices of automobiles went way up. especially used vehicles as well.

dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_29_4_short_2.wav|﻿one way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make americans poorer.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_30_long.wav|more infrastructure and innovation in america. more goods moving faster and cheaper in america. more jobs where you can earn a good living in america.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_32_long.wav|seventeen nobel laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. top business leaders and i believe most americans support the plan. here's the plan.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_34_1_long.wav|but drug companies charge families like joshua and his dad up to thirty times of that amount. i spoke with joshua's mom. imagine what it's like to look at your child who needs insulin to stay healthy.

dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_43_1_long.wav|and my distinguished congress woman, we come from the land of corporate america. there're more corporations in corporated america than every other state in america combine.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_45_1_long.wav|it'll raise billions of dollars. that's why i've proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy you don't pay who pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter. so that's my plan but we've go more detail later.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_46_1_long.wav|my plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit. the previous administration not only ballooned the deficit with those tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_46_2_long.wav|it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted. remember, we had those debates. but whether not those watchdogs should be able to see every day how much money was being spent were those going to the right place.

dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_51_2_long.wav|we’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not just degrees.

dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_52_2_long.wav|but i also know this. because of the progress we made, because of your resillience and the tools that we have been provided by this congress, tonight i can say we're moving forward.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_52_3_long.wav|we've reached a new moment in the fight against covid nineteen with severe cases are down to a level not seen since july of last year. just a few days ago the centers for desaes control in prevention issued new mask guidelines.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_53_1_long.wav|and thanks to the progress we've made in the past year, covid nineteen no longer need control our lives. i know some are talking about living with covid nineteen, but tonight i say that we never will just accept living with covid nineteen.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_53_2_long.wav|and because this virus mutates and spreads we have to stay on guard. and here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely in my view. first, stay protected with vaccines and treatments.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_53_3_long.wav|if you're vacinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. we will never give up on vaccinating more americans. now i know parents with kids under five eager to see their vaccines authorized for the children.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_53_4_long.wav|scientists are working hard to get that done we'll be ready with plenty of vaccines if and when they do. we're all ready. we are also ready with antiviral treatments.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_53_5_long.wav|i've ordered more pills than anyone in the world has. pfizer's working over time to get us a million pills this month and more than double that next month.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_54_2_long.wav|and we've already ordered free test, if you already ordered free test tonight, i'm announsing you can order another group of test covid go to covid test at guv.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_54_3_long.wav|if necessary will be able to develop new vaccines in a hundred days instead of maybe months or years. and if congress presides the funds we need we'll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, pills ready if needed.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_57_1_long.wav|most americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and moved forward safely. we achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests and masks.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_58_long.wav|the vast majority of americans have used these tools and may want again, we may need them again, so i expect congress and i hope he'll pass that quickly. fourth, we'll continue vaccinating the world.
dataset/wavs/AXxnsJaFCic_44100_59_1_long.wav|you know, we've lost so much in covid nineteen. time with one another. worst of all much loss of life. let's use this moment to reset.
